# Advanced Database Course Repository

Welcome to the repository for the Advanced Database course! This repository contains code and documentation for three labs that cover essential topics in advanced database management. Each lab focuses on a specific aspect of database design and implementation.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Hashing Collision Resolution Techniques

In this lab, we explore various hashing collision resolution techniques. The goal is to understand how to handle collisions efficiently in hash tables. The code and documentation for this lab can be found in the [./lab1](./lab1) directory.

#### Features:
- Implementation of common hashing collision resolution techniques.
- Comparative analysis of techniques based on performance metrics.

### Lab 2: Extendable Hashing

The second lab delves into extendable hashing, a dynamic hashing technique that allows for efficient dynamic file organization. Navigate to [./lab2](./lab2) to access the code and documentation.

#### Features:
- Implementation of extendable hashing.
- Evaluation of the performance and scalability of extendable hashing.

### Lab 3: NoSQL - MongoDB Lab

Lab 3 introduces NoSQL databases, with a focus on MongoDB. The [./lab3](./lab3) directory contains code and documentation for working with MongoDB.

#### Features:
- Connection setup and basic CRUD operations in MongoDB.
- Data modeling and querying using MongoDB.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the labs, follow the instructions provided in their respective directories. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and a suitable development environment set up.
